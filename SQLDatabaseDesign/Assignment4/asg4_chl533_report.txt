	These are records listing the unemployment rate, number of houses that
started construction in the time period, the federal interest rate and addition three 
fields that describe the percentage change compared to prior year for each indexes. 
As I was running several queries on my data set I was quite convinced that it was 
reliable because the indexes were coherent with economic events or historical events 
that greatly impacted the economy. For example the unemployment rate slightly 
increased after September of 2001 and federal interest rates dropped drastically in the
following months. Also the unemployment rate for the years after the ¡®Great Recession¡¯ 
in September 2008 constantly increased and the number of houses that underwent 
construction decreased significantly and persistently. If we look at the percentage change
in number of houses that started construction, it is a negative value for a majority of 
periods after the incident. Obviously federal interest rates didn¡¯t exceed 1% for over 8 years
after. In addition the data was coherent with other historical events such as the first and 
second oil shock as well as the Gulf wars. 
	The result was in line with my anticipation that number of houses undergoing 
construction will have a correlation with economic indexes. However, I believe it is not enough
to predict real estate prices. If I were to continue research on the data, integrating GDP growth
indexes and real estate prices will greatly enhance the readability of the economic trend 
and the real estate market.
