<P>     The unemployment index as well as the federal interest rate is a key indicator of the economic well-being. Normally they have a inverse relation as the 'Federal Open Market Committee' regulate economic overheating by increasing federal interest rates and unemployment is relatively low due to the good condition of the overall economy. The dataset is reliable as the indexes provideded are coherent with major historical events that had great impact on the economy. Intuitively the number of houses that start construction will increase as the economy prospers and vice versa. The current representation of data holds importance because it not only shows a correlating trend in these three indexes but also questions in reverse whether the number of houses starting construction can act as a pre-indicator of the economic status. The table provides percentage change in these indexes comparing each time period (months)
