    <p>     Looking at the graphed data we can see a clear correlation between the three indexes; unemployment rate, number of houses that started construction and federal interest rates. Unemployment and federal interest rates seemed to have a reversed relation where if unemployment was high then federal interest rates were low after some time because federal interest rates are an after response to an overheated economy or an economic recession. The interesting conclusion was that number of houses that started construction also fluctuated in accordance to these indexes. However, number of houses that started construction fluctuated constantly in between short periods of time and also there was some buffer time before current economic status started to take effect on the real estate market. In conclusion it is hard to estimate real estate prices looking at these indexes however it might give a general idea of what the market should expect. In this sense real estate investors or government organizations who are looking at the long term might find this information useful.</p>
